                          Our story begins like most first meetings Joe has in his life. It was awkward, short, and he talked about being italian too much. We were both at a high school party, pretty sure this was his first, and my friend liked one of his friends. Neither of us thought much of it, and we wouldn’t see each other for another five years. After I graduated from Kentucky, I moved back to Columbus to begin teaching. I was out in the Short North one night and Joe recognized me at the bar. We talked for a bit. Shockingly, this conversation went over a lot better and we started talking. I decided to move back to Lexington over the summer but we kept in contact, meeting up a few times a month in Cincinnati, Columbus, and Lexington. After that summer, I moved back to Columbus permanently and we started to build our life together. Since then we’ve shared so many wonderful experiences together. We’ve traveled to over fifty cities in eight countries, raised a dog, bought a home, and have both gone through career transitions.
